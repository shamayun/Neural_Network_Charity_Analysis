# Neural Network Charity Analysis
## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:
The purpose of this project is to use deep-learning neural networks with the TensorFlow platform in Python, to analyze and classify the success of charitable donations.
We use the following methods for the analysis:
* preprocessing the data for the neural network model,
* compile, train and evaluate the model,
* optimize the model.
